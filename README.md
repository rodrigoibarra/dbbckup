You should probably create a create a cron job that runs this script everyday at a dead time... we run them around 3am, then at the end of the week run another one that creates a new one on a diff folder and erase contents in this folder and that becomes your weekly backup.

We run them daily, weekly and clean up daily, and then monthly and clean up weekly.
